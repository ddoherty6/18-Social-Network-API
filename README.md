This application reperesents the database side of a social networking application. There are two main components: users and thoughts. Within thoughts, there is functionality for reactions - as in, reactions to thoughts.

## Users

Users are the center of the application that is envisioned as the use case for this back-end API. No user can interact with the application without first registering as a user in the API (in theory).

## Thoughts
